# RAG_Project_using_Langchain_OpenAI
Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Python, LangChain, OpenAI API, and ChromaDB. Implements semantic search with OpenAI embeddings, dynamic prompts, and modular pipeline. Runs on Google Colab, handles embedding/token issues, and supports open-source fallbacks for cost efficiency.
